This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About Me
Hi! My name is Sophia Philip (She/her/hers). I am getting my MS in Health Care Policy and Management. I have had an exciting career in the arts, public health and education. I love finding new ways to build programs or services that better serve people. Originally trained in ethnography, I now employ qualitative and quantitative research as well as an user experience and service design lens to my work. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to better present my data so that audience members can more easily find the information they need. Having a repertoire of visual tools to better communicate is of great importance to uphold equity and access.
