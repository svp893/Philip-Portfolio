Hi! My name is Sophia Philip (she/her/hers), I am getting my MS in Health Care Policy and Management. I have worked across public health, education and the arts throughout my career. I am motivated by work at the intersection of systems and people, improving how they work for those they serve. My training is in ethnography and I have expanded my tool kit to include qualitative and quantitative research, service and user experience design as well as project management. My work has allowed me to tackle problems such as developing evidence-based curriculums in public schools for over 4,000 students, designing vaccine access strategies working with immigrant communities, and redesigning website experiences for patients in a statewide medical system. I seek a work environment that strives to find new ways to not only do good, but do better, whether it's overhauling a system to revising an interface.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to better present my data so that audience members can more easily find the information they need. Having a repertoire of visual tools to better communicate is of great importance to uphold equity and access.

## Data Visualization #1

## Assignment 2 - Visualizing Government Debt

The following graphs use OECD data featuring the Debt-to-GDP ratio across several countries and decades. By sifting through this data on platforms, such as Flourish and Tableau, we begin to see the stories intertwined in the data.  

### Visualizaion 1: Government Debt Chart

[Click here to check out OECD Data Government Debt Visualization](https://svp893.github.io/Philip-Portfolio/dataviz2.html)

### Visualization 2: Grid of Lines Chart

Flourish offered an oportunity to break apart each country's profile over time to compare and contrast in unique grids. By playing with the palette, I chose to preserve an off white background and sharpen the contrast by introducting black and dark red in the graphs. Since the audience was not specified, the title was left as a statement of the information. I had to play around with the x-axis to present a time line that was not overwhelmed by characters. Overall, I think I presented a simple, yet striking, portrait. The hover feature in the original debt graph carried over here, makes the data more dynamic. I chose to keep the timeline at the very bottom to avoid clutter, however, it does create extra actions to scroll down to see it, an issue that was not there in the first graph. I think being able to filter out only the country's of interest would better serve the audience to find the information they seek.

### Visualization 3: Flourish based Comparative Profile Chart

For the third visualization I chose a horizantel bar chart to compare the debt across countries given the year. The play animation I found enables the viewer to see how country's debt changes over time relative to the rest of the world. Compared to the other graphs, I find this is the most "alive", as the graph shows how a country's debt changes over time. Being able to see that change animated next too others helps illustrate connections that might be occuring concurrently to encourage that change, or discovery that there may be unexpected co-influences. Ironically, it was through this visualization I saw a change I could make in the title, stating how audience should use this to compare. Because of my own limited knowledge of the data, I did not feel confident to suggest a trend that the audience should pay attention to in the title. I could see how writing "Debt Continues to Rise As We Change Centuries" might work, but I'd prefer to avoid misleading headers. Unfortunately, the platform has limited options to create a gradient, however, I was able to create hierarchy given the value of the debt by having the largest debt holders be represented by longer bars at the top that are more dark in color. I used W3schools to find a gradient of colors that are HTML compatible to make the six countries with the largest debt in 1995 to allow a point of comparison as time progresses. I colorcoded OECD as yellow to serve as a average of comparison for the rest of the countries; however, since it only appears from 2007-2020 I would be open to removing that color marker. I also chose yellow, blue and grey as they are optimal for different audiences based on visual abilities and colorblindess and don't suggest  "good" or "bad". I could see a reason to use more foreboding colors as debt is negative. The goal of these color choices is that users can easily compare where a country stands relative to other given the year, not to suggest a negative connotation.

## Assignment #3 and #4

### Original Visualization

[Annenberg Public Policy Center ASK Survey, July 2022](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/survey-1-in-5-americans-fear-getting-monkeypox-but-many-know-little-about-it/)

![Annenberg data viz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/Annenberg%20Original%20Chart.png.jpg)

I selected this data visualization as I have worked and am planning to continue working in public health. I wanted to explore how the process of designing a visualization may impact the impression the audience has regarding the seriousness of an emergent illness, in this case Monkeypox. In reflection of how COVID-19 information was disseminated from the state to global level, there is much to be gained from exploring effective health visualizations. 
I found this data visualization to be significant as it aimed to explore the current levels of worry around contracting Monkeypox; however, I felt the visual could be adjusted in several ways:

<li>The range of colors made it difficult to quickly ascertain what percentage of people are worried</li> 
<li>The title of the visualization is only the question asked in the survey, without context provided in the article, it is difficult to know the takeaway from people’s responses and how it connects to the bigger picture</li>
<li>There is too much text, and in varying font colors, that further hinder the perceptibility</li>
<li>Having the date of the survey be referenced in the footer is extremely helpful for reliability as it shows the relevancy </li>
<li>The comparison of COVID-19 and Monkeypox is not clearly explained through the title and leaves the audience to infer why there is a comparison</li>
<li>Providing more information on the size of the sample and demographics would have contributed to its truthfulness by offering transparency of the sampling process</li>
<li>Would it serve the purpose of the article better to reduce the number of categories and change the style of graph? </li>
 <br>
With these reflections as my starting point, I began iterating…

### Iteration 1
![complexbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/complex%20bar%20chart.jpg)
The first sketch explored using a gradient of colors and gray to de-emphasize the data of people who are not worried. I kept all the categories and original bar chart format. I kept this wireframe undetailed as I recognized I would need to reduce the number of variables shown. 

### Iteration 2
![simple bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/Simplified%20bar%20chart.JPG)
The second sketch has reduced categories, "worried" and "not worried". I used red to signal a negative or warning connotation and includeded the title "Americans worry about getting Monkeyox as it continues to rise in a pandemic landscape". I felt the title was misleading as I did not have data showing it was rising alongside this chart. 

### Iteration 3
![3 color pie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/3%20color%20pie.JPG)
I shifted to a pie chart, creating a three color visual to see if the new format would make the sub categories more effective. In the end, I found it to still be too cluttered. I switched to purple as I felt red or orange hues were too alarmist. 
 
### Iteration 4
![2 color pie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/2%20color%20pie.JPG)
Reducing the categories to two allowed me to get right to the point of the data. I still was not satisfied with the title but waited for feedback to adjust. 

### Bonus Iteration
![people chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/People%20graph.JPG)
I added in this wireframe as I think the title of the article would have been better supported with a data visualization of model people representing the proportions seeing as the title is: "Survey: 1 in 5 Americans Fear Getting Monkeypox but Many Know Little About It". 

### Visualization Critique
I showed two individuals Iteration 4, the two color pie chart.

#### Participant 1 (64 year old female):
The participant was able to tell that the graphs represented people who were and were not worried about getting COVID-19 or Monkeypox, purple being those who are worried, gray being those who are not. Overall, they found the two color system to be effective. They were indifferent about the title as they felt they got the information they needed to know from the visualization alone. The paticipant expressed interest in wanting to know the total sample size so as to understand what proportion of the US population the percentages represented. 

#### Participant 2 (23 year old male):
The participant could tell that the visualization was showing them a comparison of Americans that are worried about Monkeypox versus COVID-19. The participant suggested making the titles of each pie chart the same color as the wedge, i.e. purple, so as to help them make the connection between the pie slice representing concern for that disease. They were surprised that concern regarding Monkeypox was so low and would have liked to have seen the date of data collection. Overall, the visualization is concise, easy to read and allowed them to quickly get to what is important for them: who is worried about what. The participant was also curious to know where sample participants were from; however, the website does not give access to that data. 

### Final Revised Data Visualization

Based off of the feedback and the data I had access to via the original site, I was able to create the two color pie chart in FLourish. I decided to make the following adjustments:

<li>Changed the title to "Current Concern for Americans as Monkeypox Continues to Spread Amidst Pandemic Landscape"</li>
<li>Added in a subheader of date of data collection and how many sample participants</li>
<li>I changed the color to a marigold yellow for a cautionary effect</li>
<li>I made sure to include the source as participants seemed interested in knowing where the data came from</li>
<li> My goal was to contextualize the data given the article was focused on sharing information regarding concern and how that tied into people's knowledge of Monkeypox. I would have been interested in creating a visualization correlating concern of Monkeypox given participant location or level of knowledge of Monkeypox. Unfortunately, that data was not available. I learned through these exercises that finding health related data sets and visualizations needing improvement can sometimes be difficult as often privacy and liabilty hinders institutions from sharing complete information. Although the data for this visualization was limited, I felt I was able to practice the best methods to provide clear information, succintly and honestly.
