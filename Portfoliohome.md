Hi! My name is Sophia Philip (she/her/hers), I am getting my MS in Health Care Policy and Management. I have worked across public health, education and the arts throughout my career. I am motivated by work at the intersection of systems and people, improving how they work for those they serve. My training is in ethnography and I have expanded my tool kit to include qualitative and quantitative research, service and user experience design as well as project management. My work has allowed me to tackle problems such as developing evidence-based curriculums in public schools for over 4,000 students, designing vaccine access strategies working with immigrant communities, and redesigning website experiences for patients in a statewide medical system. I seek a work environment that strives to find new ways to not only do good, but do better, whether it's overhauling a system to revising an interface.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to better present my data so that audience members can more easily find the information they need. Having a repertoire of visual tools to better communicate is of great importance to uphold equity and access.

## Assignment 2 - Visualizing Government Debt

### Government Debt Chart

### Grid of Lines Chart
Using OECD data from 1995 to 2021, I have created a visualization of the Debt-to-GDP ratio to better understand the economic landscape of various countries over time. Each of these graphs reflect a country's government debt from 1995-2021.

### Third (and Fourth) Data Visualization
I continued to explore various ways to present the OECD Debt-to-GDP Ratio focusing on either year or country. The third version offers a horizantel bar chart to compare the debt across countries given the year. The play animation enables the viewer to see how country's debt changes over time relative to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the platform has limited options to create a gradient, however, I was able to create hierarchy given the value of the debt. Users can easily compare where a country stands relative to other given the year. 

### Year Focus

The fourth version of the visualization provides an opportunity to evaluate an individual country's standing from 1995 to 2021. All countries can be viewed simultaneously across this time period, however, the inability to color code the countries makes it difficult to decipher the data.
