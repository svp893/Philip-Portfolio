------------------------------------------

### User Research Protocol
#### Target Audience
The audience I hope to reach is young to mid aged adults. My intention is to raise awareness to the unnecessary loss of life amongst communities that are either of child bearing age or know someone who is, thus young to middle aged. Regardless of gender, everyone is affected by or knows someone who is planning to get pregnant; that is why the site shoudl be built to be engaging to all genders. Centering gender inclusivity is also essential to inhibit biases and barriers to care access. Health data is often difficult to understand or only accessible via health care news platforms or journals. By creating a site that is made to be accessible visually as well as its language to young and mid aged adults, I intend to make the issue understood and the means to combat the issue available and ready for action. 

#### Identifying Representative Interview Candidates
Finding representative interview candidates required contacting those in proximity as well as others farther away. I identified three candidates, two of whom live nearby and another that I had to interact with via Zoom because they live far away. I tried to have each participant be from a different age group, i.e. 20s-70s, as well as different career types and from different areas.  

#### Interview Script
***Introductory Comments***
<br> 
"Hello, my name is Sophia Philip, I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. Thank you for agreeing to participate in my research today for my class "Telling Stories with Data". You will be asked to review a website I have created. I will ask you a few questions to which you can reply to all, some or none. My goal is to get feedback on a new page I am designing. I'm talking to people to see what makes sense and what's confusing on the website. Your identity will be kept anonymous and this feedback session should take less than 20 minutes of your time. Do you have any questions?

***Questions about Interviewee***
<br>
"What's your job/what do you do? How old are you? Where are you from?"

***Main Section***
<br>
"I am going to send you a link to a website. I'd like you to take a few minutes to scroll through. Tell me when you are done scrolling through. Once you are done, I want you to tell me what you think this site is for, in your own words?"

"Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?"

"Can you please tell me which parts of the site helped you figure out what this site was about. How did these parts make it easier to understand the goal of the site?"

"Which parts of the site were confusing? Why? What would you have done differently?"

"What other questions do you have about the site?"

As the participant works through the page, the interviewer will ask follow-up questions as necessary and respond to any questions with further discussion.

***Wrap-up***
<br>
“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”

#### Findings from Interview 

I interviewed three participants using the interview script. The following section presents their background information and feedback. Identifiers of the participants have been adjusted to be general enough to preserve anonymity.
<br>
##### Participant 1 
*65 year old, white male, originally from the the Northeast of the United States, retired*
<br>
After reviewing the site I asked them what they understood the goal of the site to be, this is their reply: "Discussing maternal mortality rates, to identify there is a problem, but I can’t tell if it identifies a solution." They felt the audience was someone who had the basic knowledge in the field of maternal health and has a concern for the topic. Overall, they had a hard time dealing with the format. This was an interesting contrast, as later on in the interview, they said the website was well laid out. With further prompting I learned that they felt the information given to them through the graphs could have been in simpler language and clearer context. They liked that the website could be paced the way they preferred and not "auto-driven. I could stop it when I needed and slow it down." They emphasized that the charts needed to be "stupid simple". The use of images and constant repition of "maternal mortality" extablished a clear theme of the seriousness of the siutation for mother and child alike. 
<br>
##### Participant 2
*64 year old, white female, originally from the Midwest of the United States, freelance*
<br>
Before I could start my script, the participant immediately jumped into giving feedback on the site. They needed clarification on the difference between maternal mortality as well as pregnancy mortality-what are they and are they the same? They did not understand what "per 100,000 live births" meant and asked for different units to be used. The OECD data on US's standing relative to other countries was also not clear to the participant. They were impressed by the data visualization on the increasing trend of maternal mortality. I had tested out using gender neutral language, such as "parents" instead of "mothers", and the participant was confused and thought it was wrong. This brings up a great discussion on framing gender neutral terms in a way that ensures all audiences understand why "parent" is being used instead of the gendered "mother". They noticed that the language throughout the site switched from "livelihood" to "deaths" and recommended picking one or the other to ensure clarity. The pie chart on race and ethnicity greatly impressed them and they liked the colors. After talking about the pie chart, they said aloud "I wonder why" race and ethnicity were so significant, which makes me think I should discuss this more in my next iteration. They asked for clarification on medical terms in the bar chart featuring causes of maternal mortality. After sharing this feedback, I was able to ask the intial questions regarding the goal and audience, they replied the goal is "two fold, one is awareness of maternal mortality and, two, is how you can do something about it"; however, they had no idea who the audience is for the site. When asked what they liked about the site they shared that they loved the photos, except the doula training photo, most graphs are easy to read, they like that a celebrity is mentioned, the pie chart is great and, overall, and the site is interesting. They wanted to know about more options in the action stpes, such as advocacy places that pregnant mothers could go to or hospitals systems that have community outreach who don’t have insurance. These suggestions helped me see that I was able to inspire my audience but had more edits to make.  
<br>
##### Participant 3
*23 year old, white male, originally from the Midwest of the United States, graduate student*
<br>
The participant said the goal of the site is to show how US maternal mortality rates are drastically higher than in other parts of the world. The noted that there are large racial and ethnic disparities that impact those rates. In their opinion the site is for doctors, caregivers, doulas and expecting parents. We proceeded to have a discussion about adding in a disclosure that gender inclusive language will be used, e.g. "parent" instead of "mother", throughout the site, which responds to the questions Participant 2 had regarding the language around parent versus mother. Recognizing that this is a wireframe, they expressed excitement to learn more about Serena Williams and what the CDC is currently doing ot reduce the mortality rates. In regards to aesthetics, they recommended making the sub title larger, increasing the buble size for the US in the first visualization, adjusting the trend stacked area chart to a line graph with comparison to other countries and adding in more photos for the PMSS section. They reminded me that gradients are not appropriate for different categories so they suggested I use the palette of the pie chart. Similar to the other participants, they suggested simplifying the chart titles. They made other suggestions regarding playing around with photo placement relative to visuals which I will test out. They were excited by the action steps and liked the buttons. 
<br>
#### Changes to Visuals based on Interviews 

I was very lucky to have such enthusiasic participants and had a lot of feedback to work with. Unfortunately, I was not able to get feedback during class as we ran out of time. However, I noted the feedback we gave to my peers and the following list captures the changes I plan to make given both the user feedback I conducted as well as that given to others during class. 
<br>
<li> Adjust palette of charts to reflect the pie chart</li>
<li> Remove gradient from charts </li>
<li> Adjust language of charts to be more accessible. This may resolve the discrepancy in the perception of user type for this site </li>
<li> Find alternative language to maternal and pregnancy-related mortality </li>
<li> Be explicit around what actions are being taken to address the mortality rates </li>
<li> Develop a statement regarding the adjustment to gendered language to gender inclusive language </li>
<li> Add in more photos to ensure images are not too static and take advantage of scrolling features of Shorthand </li>
<li> I added in a navigation menu following the class critique, I will continue to adjust the language </li>
<li> The line graph showing where the US stands needs to either have larger sized dots or I should simplify the groups to continents to make it easier to see </li>
<li> I am going to add more countries to the stacked area graph to make it easier to see comparisons of trend increase and will adjust to a line graph. </li>
<li> Flush out action items and integrate suggestions from Participant 2, such as pregnant parent support for those uninsured </li>
