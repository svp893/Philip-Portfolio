# Assignment 2 - Visualizing Government Debt

The following graphs use OECD data featuring the Debt-to-GDP ratio across several countries and decades. By sifting through this data on platforms, such as Flourish and Tableau, we begin to see the stories intertwined in the data.

## Visualization 2: Grid of Lines Chart

Flourish offered an oportunity to break apart each country's profile over time to compare and contrast in unique grids. By playing with the palette, I chose to preserve an off white background and sharpen the contrast by introducting black and dark red in the graphs. Since the audience was not specified, the title was left as a statement of the information. I had to play around with the x-axis to present a time line that was not overwhelmed by characters. Overall, I think I presented a simple, yet striking, portrait. The hover feature in the original debt graph carried over here, makes the data more dynamic. I chose to keep the timeline at the very bottom to avoid clutter, however, it does create extra actions to scroll down to see it, an issue that was not there in the first graph. I think being able to filter out only the country's of interest would better serve the audience to find the information they seek.

## Visualization 3: Flourish based Comparative Profile Chart

For the third visualization I chose a horizantel bar chart to compare the debt across countries given the year. The play animation I found enables the viewer to see how country's debt changes over time relative to the rest of the world. Compared to the other graphs, I find this is the most "alive", as the graph shows how a country's debt changes over time. Being able to see that change animated next too others helps illustrate connections that might be occuring concurrently to encourage that change, or discovery that there may be unexpected co-influences. Ironically, it was through this visualization I saw a change I could make in the title, stating how audience should use this to compare. Because of my own limited knowledge of the data, I did not feel confident to suggest a trend that the audience should pay attention to in the title. I could see how writing "Debt Continues to Rise As We Change Centuries" might work, but I'd prefer to avoid misleading headers. Unfortunately, the platform has limited options to create a gradient, however, I was able to create hierarchy given the value of the debt by having the largest debt holders be represented by longer bars at the top that are more dark in color. I used W3schools to find a gradient of colors that are HTML compatible to make the six countries with the largest debt in 1995 to allow a point of comparison as time progresses. I colorcoded OECD as yellow to serve as a average of comparison for the rest of the countries; however, since it only appears from 2007-2020 I would be open to removing that color marker. I also chose yellow, blue and grey as they are optimal for different audiences based on visual abilities and colorblindess and don't suggest  "good" or "bad". I could see a reason to use more foreboding colors as debt is negative. The goal of these color choices is that users can easily compare where a country stands relative to other given the year, not to suggest a negative connotation.
