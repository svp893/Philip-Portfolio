# Data Visualization #2

The following bar chart is the data visualization generated by the OECD site. The data is pulled from the year 2018 and various countries are randomly selected, which is illustrated by the bar of that country being shown in a non-grey color. The graph offers a quick overview of where countries stand. However, the lack of clarty that the y-axis represents GDP-to-Dept ratio and the inability to adjust the colored bars means it is hard to understand the data without pre-existing knowledge. Although helpful to see the countries, the density of the words and the organization by size of dept makes it difficult to quickly find a country. The grey bars help us focus on the highlighted countries, but the audience has littel autonomy to shift the focus.
