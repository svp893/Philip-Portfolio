# Final Project

## Part 1

### Project Summary
The final project will be reporting on the current landscape of maternal health in the United States and the suprisingly high rates of maternal and infant mortality across different identity demographics. The goal is to further humanize the staggering number of unnecessary maternal and infant deaths as well as solutions that are currently being or can be implemented to reduce those rates.

### Project Structure

#### Set up: 
<li>Illustrate current reproducive health landscape, i.e. maternal and infant deaths have remained at high levels in the United States.</li>
<li> Present data visualizations that show these negative trends related to mortality rates and comparisons to other countries </li>

#### Conflict: 
<li> Despite US being a first world country with highest health care costs, preventable maternal and infant deaths persist. </li>
<li> Present data visualization that illustrate influential factors, i.e. socio-economics, as well other extraneous factors further exacerbate these patterns
<li> The persistance is due to inaccessibility of care, continued disenfranchisement and neglect of subset patient populations, across race and nationality. </li>
<li> Provide data visualizations that reveal disparities across particular maternal populations, such as along race or nationality </li>

#### Resolution:
<li> Propose action items, ideas and current policy to decrease maternal mortality rates </li>
<li> Present current policy to increase maternal health coverage, show impact in similiar countries of increasing coverage on maternal health </li>
<li> Provide alternative ideas, determine if data visualizations are available. For example, investment in expanding racial representation in maternal health fields or revising maternal health education in medical schools </li>

### Initial Project Sketches

### Data Sources
The following data sets will be used for my final project:

[The Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/apr/health-and-health-care-women-reproductive-age)
offers comparative data on reproductive health across several nations. These data sets explore both physical health, as well as the interplay of socio-economics, care behavior, mental health and access ot care. These data sets offer richer detail to help build out a nuanced and ecosystemic story of maternal mortality rates in the United States. From this data, I can also begin to explore solutions that are found in higher performing countries to propose in my final project.

[Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fmaternalinfanthealth%2Fpregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm)
Data sets specifically on pregnancy mortality rates from the state to national level. Offers information on levels and causes of mortality rates.

[Sudden Unexptected Infant Deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm)
A subdivision of the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health that offers data on Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID) by cause, trends in SUID rates by cause, SUID by race/ethnicity, and data resources for SUID and sudden infant death syndrome.

### Method and Medium
To complete this project I will do the following:

<li> Revise final project plan given in class critique offered on 9.27.22 </li>
<li>Flush out the project structure and identify which data sets and what types of imagery are needed to support the key points for each section in the revised plan. Begin writing out text for story </li>
<li> After class on 9.27.22, begin building out the basic structure of the site </li>
<li> Begin collecting relevant images and store in image repository on GitHub </li>
<li> Evaluate if Flourish or Tableau offers better capability given the type of data </li>
<li> Import and build data visualizations for each section. </li>
<li> Review initial research for Part 1 and pull out key takeaways from data visualizations to build narrative. </li>
<li> Revise text and refine use of images and visualizations to build strong story </li>
<li> Organize critique through class time and with peers outside of class </li>
<li> Revise final project given critique </li>
<li> Prepare short presentation highlighting key data visualizations </li>
<li> Finalize final project and presentation </li>
