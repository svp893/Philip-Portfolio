# Final Project
## Part 1
### Project Summary
The final project will be reporting on the current landscape of maternal health in the United States and the suprisingly high rates of maternal and infant mortality across different identity demographics. The goal is to further humanize the staggering number of unnecessary maternal and infant deaths as well as solutions that are currently being or can be implemented to reduce those rates.

### Project Structure
Read ch. 8
Set up: Maternal and infant deaths have remained at high levels.
Conflict: 
Despite US being a first world country with highest health care costs, preventable maternal and infant deaths persist.
The persistance is due to inaccessibility of care, continued disenfranchisement and neglect of subset patient populations, across race and nationality.
Resolution:
Policy to increase maternal health coverage
Investment in expanding racial representation in maternal health fields
Revising maternal health education in medical schools

### Data Sources
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

I am using a combination of two data sources:
<li> [The Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/apr/health-and-health-care-women-reproductive-age) </li>
The Commonwealth Fund offers comparative data on reproductive health across several nations. These data sets explore both physical health, as well as the interplay of socio-economics, care behavior, mental health and access ot care. These data sets offer richer detail to help build out a nuanced and ecosystemic story of maternal mortality rates in the United States. From this data, I can also begin to explore solutions that are found in higher performing countries to propose in my final project.  
<li>Center for Disease Control and Prevention</li>

### Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.
