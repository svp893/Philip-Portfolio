### Project Summary
The final project will be reporting on the current landscape of maternal health in the United States and the suprisingly high rates of maternal and infant mortality across different identity demographics. The goal is to further humanize the staggering number of unnecessary maternal and infant deaths as well as solutions that are currently being or can be implemented to reduce those rates.

### Project Structure

#### Set up: 
<li>Illustrate current reproducive health landscape, i.e. maternal and infant deaths have remained at high levels in the United States.</li>
<li> Present data visualizations that show these negative trends related to mortality rates and comparisons to other countries </li>

#### Conflict: 
<li> Despite US being a first world country with highest health care costs, preventable maternal and infant deaths persist. </li>
<li> Present data visualization that illustrate influential factors, i.e. socio-economics, as well other extraneous factors further exacerbate these patterns </li>
<li> The persistance is due to inaccessibility of care, continued disenfranchisement and neglect of subset patient populations, across race and nationality. </li>
<li> Provide data visualizations that reveal disparities across particular maternal populations, such as along race or nationality </li>

#### Resolution:
<li> Propose action items, ideas and current policy to decrease maternal mortality rates </li>
<li> Present current policy to increase maternal health coverage, show impact in similiar countries of increasing coverage on maternal health </li>
<li> Provide alternative ideas, determine if data visualizations are available. For example, investment in expanding racial representation in maternal health fields or revising maternal health education in medical schools </li>

### Data Sources
The following data sets will be used for my final project:

[The Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/apr/health-and-health-care-women-reproductive-age)
offers comparative data on reproductive health across several nations. These data sets explore both physical health, as well as the interplay of socio-economics, care behavior, mental health and access ot care. These data sets offer richer detail to help build out a nuanced and ecosystemic story of maternal mortality rates in the United States. From this data, I can also begin to explore solutions that are found in higher performing countries to propose in my final project.

[Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fmaternalinfanthealth%2Fpregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm); data sets specifically on pregnancy mortality rates from the state to national level. Offers information on levels and causes of mortality rates.

[OECD](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20United%20States,capita%20across%20the%20OECD%20countries.) data will be used to illustrate how United States health care spending stands relative to other countries. 

### Method and Medium
To complete this project I will do the following:

<li> I will be using Flourish and Tableau to build my visualizations. Given the data I have, I will test out my initial data visualizations and adjust accordingly to ensure I tell the strongest story in the clearest manner </li>
<li> I will initially draft out the text for my final project either in Microsoft Word or Github to then finalize in the platform the final projected will be presented on </li>
<li> I will use Unsplash for stock imagery </li>
<li> I will use Shorthand to build my final project site </li>

### Post-Critique Revisions
After receiving feedback on my original plan. I will be reducing the amount of data visualizations I had planned to build, as shown in the Figma mock up. The group's critique was out of concern for limited time and ensuring that I was concise and did not overwhelm my site with data visualizations. I was planning to go into detail on spending behavior of mothers but will instead just focus on a more high level presentation of data. For the action items, I need to identify more clear next steps, such as opportunities to train to be a doula or ways to support increase maternal health spending through voting or advocacy.
