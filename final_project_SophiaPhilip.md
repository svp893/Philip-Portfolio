# Final Project

## Part 1

### Project Summary
The final project will be reporting on the current landscape of maternal health in the United States and the suprisingly high rates of maternal and infant mortality across different identity demographics. The goal is to further humanize the staggering number of unnecessary maternal and infant deaths as well as solutions that are currently being or can be implemented to reduce those rates.

### Project Structure

#### Set up: 
<li>Illustrate current reproducive health landscape, i.e. maternal and infant deaths have remained at high levels in the United States.</li>
<li> Present data visualizations that show these negative trends related to mortality rates and comparisons to other countries </li>

#### Conflict: 
<li> Despite US being a first world country with highest health care costs, preventable maternal and infant deaths persist. </li>
<li> Present data visualization that illustrate influential factors, i.e. socio-economics, as well other extraneous factors further exacerbate these patterns </li>
<li> The persistance is due to inaccessibility of care, continued disenfranchisement and neglect of subset patient populations, across race and nationality. </li>
<li> Provide data visualizations that reveal disparities across particular maternal populations, such as along race or nationality </li>

#### Resolution:
<li> Propose action items, ideas and current policy to decrease maternal mortality rates </li>
<li> Present current policy to increase maternal health coverage, show impact in similiar countries of increasing coverage on maternal health </li>
<li> Provide alternative ideas, determine if data visualizations are available. For example, investment in expanding racial representation in maternal health fields or revising maternal health education in medical schools </li>

### Data Sources
The following data sets will be used for my final project:

[The Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/apr/health-and-health-care-women-reproductive-age)
offers comparative data on reproductive health across several nations. These data sets explore both physical health, as well as the interplay of socio-economics, care behavior, mental health and access ot care. These data sets offer richer detail to help build out a nuanced and ecosystemic story of maternal mortality rates in the United States. From this data, I can also begin to explore solutions that are found in higher performing countries to propose in my final project.

[Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fmaternalinfanthealth%2Fpregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm); data sets specifically on pregnancy mortality rates from the state to national level. Offers information on levels and causes of mortality rates.

[OECD](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20United%20States,capita%20across%20the%20OECD%20countries.) data will be used to illustrate how United States health care spending stands relative to other countries. 

### Method and Medium
To complete this project I will do the following:

<li> I will be using Flourish and Tableau to build my visualizations. Given the data I have, I will test out my initial data visualizations and adjust accordingly to ensure I tell the strongest story in the clearest manner </li>
<li> I will initially draft out the text for my final project either in Microsoft Word or Github to then finalize in the platform the final projected will be presented on </li>
<li> I will use Unsplash for stock imagery </li>
<li> I will use Shorthand to build my final project site </li>

### Post-Critique Revisions
After receiving feedback on my original plan. I will be reducing the amount of data visualizations I had planned to build, as shown in the Figma mock up. The group's critique was out of concern for limited time and ensuring that I was concise and did not overwhelm my site with data visualizations. I was planning to go into detail on spending behavior of mothers but will instead just focus on a more high level presentation of data. For the action items, I need to identify more clear next steps, such as opportunities to train to be a doula or ways to support increase maternal health spending through voting or advocacy.

### User Research Protocol
#### Target Audience
The intended audience I hope to reach is young to mid aged adults. My intention is to raise awareness to the unnecessary loss of life amongst communities that are either of child bearing age or know someone who is, thus young to middle aged. Regardless of gender, everyone is affected by or knows someone who is planning to get pregnant; that is why the site shoudl be built to be engaging to all genders. Centering gender inclusivity is also essential to inhibit biases and barriers to care access. Health data is often difficult to understand or only accessible via health care news platforms or journals. By creating a site that is made to be accessible visually as well as its language to young and mid aged adults, I intend to make the issue understood and the means to combat the issue available and ready for action. 

#### Identifying Representative Interview Candidates
Finding representative interview candidates required contacting those in proximity as well as others farther away. I identified three candidates, two of whom live nearby and another that I had to interact with via Zoom because they live far away. I tried to have each participant be from a different age group, i.e. 20s-70s, as well as different career types and from different areas.  

#### Interview Script
***Introductory Comments***
<br> 
"Hello, my name is Sophia Philip, I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. Thank you for agreeing to participate in my research today for my class "Telling Stories with Data". You will be asked to review a website I have created. I will ask you a few questions to which you can reply to all, some or none. My goal is to get feedback on a new page I am designing. I'm talking to people to see what makes sense and what's confusing on the website. Your identity will be kept anonymous and this feedback session should take less than 20 minutes of your time. Do you have any questions?

***Questions about Interviewee***
<br>
"What's your job/what do you do? How old are you? Where are you from?"

***Main Section***
<br>
"I am going to send you a link to a website. I'd like you to take a few minutes to scroll through. Tell me when you are done scrolling through. Once you are done, I want you to tell me what you think this site is for, in your own words?"

"Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?"

"Can you please tell me which parts of the site helped you figure out what this site was about. How did these parts make it easier to understand the goal of the site?"

"Which parts of the site were confusing? Why? What would you have done differently?"

"What other questions do you have about the site?"

As the participant works through the page, the interviewer will ask follow-up questions as necessary and respond to any questions with further discussion.

***Wrap-up***
<br>
“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”

#### Findings from Interview 

I interviewed three participants using the interview script. The following section presents their background information and feedback. Identifiers of the participants have been adjusted to be general enough to preserve anonymity.

##### Participant 1 
65 year old, white male, originally from the the Northeast of the United States, retired
<br>
After reviewing the site I asked them what they understood the goal of the site to be, this is their reply: "Discussing maternal mortality rates, to identify there is a problem, but I can’t tell if it identifies a solution." They felt the audience was someone who had the basic knowledge in the field of maternal health and has a concern for the topic. Overall, they had a hard time dealing with the format. This was an interesting contrast, as later on in the interview, they said the website was well laid out. With further prompting I learned that they felt the information given to them through the graphs could have been in simpler language and clearer context. They liked that the website could be paced the way they preferred and not "auto-driven. I could stop it when I needed and slow it down." They emphasized that the charts needed to be "stupid simple". The use of images and constant repition of "maternal mortality" extablished a clear theme of the seriousness of the siutation for mother and child alike. 

##### Participant 2
64 year old, white female, originally from the Midwest of the United States, freelance
<br>
Before I could start my script, the participant immediately jumped into giving feedback on the site. They needed clarification on the difference between maternal mortality as well as pregnancy mortality-what are they and are they the same? They did not understand what "per 100,000 live births" meant and asked for different units to be used. They were impressed by the data visualization on the increasing trend of maternal mortality. I had tested out using gender neutral language, such as 
"parents" instead of "mothers", and the participant was confused and thought it was wrong. This bring up a great discussion on framing gender neutral terms in a way that ensures all audiences understand why "parent" is being used instead of the gendered "mother". They noticed that the language throughout the site switched from "livelihood" to "deaths" and recommended picking one or the other to ensure clarity. The pie chart on race and ethnicity greatly impressed them and they liked the colors. After talking about the pie chart, they said aloud "I wonder why" race and ethnicity were so significant, which makes me think I should discuss this more in my next iteration. They asked for clarification on medical terms in the bar chart featuring causes of maternal mortality. After sharing this feedback, I was able to ask the intial questions regarding the goal and audience, they replied the goal is "two fold, one is awareness of maternal mortality and, two, is how you can do something about it"; however, they had no idea who the audience is for the site. When asked what they liked abou tthe site they shared that they loved the photos, graphs are easy to read, they like that a celebrity is mentioned, the pie chart is great and, overall, the site is interesting/  
Audience: I have no idea

Our country is so messed up what more could go wrong
I don’t know what OECD data is really saying [relative to other countries]

Are there any advocacy places that pregnant mothers could go to 
Are there any hospitals systems that have community outreach who don’t have insurance

I love the photos
Graphs are easy to read
Tehre is a celeb involved
The pie chart is good
It’s very interesting

I don’t know what’s happening to increased doula training-change photo
