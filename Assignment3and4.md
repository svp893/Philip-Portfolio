# Assignment 3 and 4

### Original Visualization

[Annenberg Public Policy Center ASK Survey, July 2022](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/survey-1-in-5-americans-fear-getting-monkeypox-but-many-know-little-about-it/)

I selected this data visualization as I have worked and am planning to continue working in public health. I wanted to explore how the process of designing a visualization may impact the impression the audience has regarding the seriousness of an emergent illness, in this case Monkeypox. In reflection of how COVID-19 information was disseminated from the state to global level, there is much to be gained from exploring effective health visualizations. 
I found this data visualization to be significant as it aimed to explore the current levels of worry around contracting Monkeypox; however, I felt the visual could be adjusted in several ways:

<li>The range of colors made it difficult to quickly ascertain what percentage of people are worried</li> 
<li>The title of the visualization is only the question asked in the survey, without context provided in the article, it is difficult to know the takeaway from people’s responses and how it connects to the bigger picture</li>
<li>The language of the visualization suggests that this graph is intended for the general public who is curious about Monkeypox</li>
<li>There is too much text, and in varying font colors, that further hinder the perceptibility</li>
<li>Having the date of the survey be referenced in the footer is extremely helpful for reliability as it shows the relevancy</li>
<li>The comparison of COVID-19 and Monkeypox is not clearly explained through the title and leaves the audience to infer why there is a comparison</li>
<li>Providing more information on the size of the sample and demographics would have contributed to its truthfulness by offering transparency of the sampling process</li>
<li>Would it serve the purpose of the article better to reduce the number of categories and change the style of graph?</li>
 <br>
With these reflections as my starting point, I began iterating…

### Iteration 1
![complexbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/complex%20bar%20chart.jpg)
The first sketch explored using a gradient of colors and gray to de-emphasize the data of people who are not worried. I kept all the categories and original bar chart format. I kept this wireframe undetailed as I recognized I would need to reduce the number of variables shown. 

### Iteration 2
![simple bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/Simplified%20bar%20chart.JPG)
The second sketch has reduced categories, "worried" and "not worried". I used red to signal a negative or warning connotation and includeded the title "Americans worry about getting Monkeyox as it continues to rise in a pandemic landscape". I felt the title was misleading as I did not have data showing it was rising alongside this chart. 

### Iteration 3
![3 color pie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/3%20color%20pie.JPG)
I shifted to a pie chart, creating a three color visual to see if the new format would make the sub categories more effective. In the end, I found it to still be too cluttered. I switched to purple as I felt red or orange hues were too alarmist. 
 
### Iteration 4
![2 color pie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/2%20color%20pie.JPG)
Reducing the categories to two allowed me to get right to the point of the data. I still was not satisfied with the title but waited for feedback to adjust. 

### Bonus Iteration
![people chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svp893/Philip-Portfolio/main/images/People%20graph.JPG)
I added in this wireframe as I think the title of the article would have been better supported with a data visualization of model people representing the proportions seeing as the title is: "Survey: 1 in 5 Americans Fear Getting Monkeypox but Many Know Little About It". 

### Visualization Critique
I showed two individuals Iteration 4, the two color pie chart.

#### Participant 1 (64 year old female):
The participant was able to tell that the graphs represented people who were and were not worried about getting COVID-19 or Monkeypox, purple being those who are worried, gray being those who are not. Overall, they found the two color system to be effective. They were indifferent about the title as they felt they got the information they needed to know from the visualization alone. The paticipant expressed interest in wanting to know the total sample size so as to understand what proportion of the US population the percentages represented. 

#### Participant 2 (23 year old male):
The participant could tell that the visualization was showing them a comparison of Americans that are worried about Monkeypox versus COVID-19. The participant suggested making the titles of each pie chart the same color as the wedge, i.e. purple, so as to help them make the connection between the pie slice representing concern for that disease. They were surprised that concern regarding Monkeypox was so low and would have liked to have seen the date of data collection. Overall, the visualization is concise, easy to read and allowed them to quickly get to what is important for them: who is worried about what. The participant was also curious to know where sample participants were from; however, the website does not give access to that data. 

### Final Revised Data Visualization

Based off of the feedback and the data I had access to via the original site, I was able to create the two color pie chart in Flourish. I decided to make the following adjustments:

<li>Changed the title to "American's Concern for Monkeypox compared to COVID-19, as of July 2022".</li>
<li>Added in a subheader of how many sample participants.</li>
<li>I changed the color to a marigold yellow for a cautionary effect. I kept "not worried" as gray to ensure the audience would focus on the smaller slice. In group critique there was feedback to have the "not worried" section be a light yellow; however, the visiblity was difficult and I found it made the audience focus on "not worried" which was counter to what the participant in the visual critique said was best for aesthetic focus.</li>
<li> I settled on a pie chart because it best captures how parts relate to wholes, in this case sub sets of a sample. Through feedback I learned that people preferred seeing how large the slice of those "worried" is in a pie chart. In the in-class critique, I showed participants the iterations of bar charts and pie charts and all preferred the pie chart. As a declarative and data-driven visualization, keeping the chart simple and a familiar pie shape seemed most appropriate given this visualization seems to be for the general public.</li>
<li>I made sure to include the source as participants seemed interested in knowing where the data came from.</li>
<li>Participant's 2 reaction to liking the binary of "worried" or "not worried" validated my inclination that simplified data categories would better serve the audiences that viewed this graph. </li>
<li> My goal was to contextualize the data given the article was focused on sharing information regarding concern and how that tied into people's knowledge of Monkeypox. I would have been interested in creating a visualization correlating concern of Monkeypox given participant location or level of knowledge of Monkeypox. Unfortunately, that data was not available. I learned through these exercises that finding health related data sets and visualizations needing improvement can sometimes be difficult as often privacy and liabilty hinders institutions from sharing complete information. Although the data for this visualization was limited, I felt I was able to practice the best methods to provide clear information, succintly and honestly.</li>
