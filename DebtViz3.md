# Third Data Visualization
I continued to explore various ways to present the OECD Debt-to-GDP Ratio playing with either year or country as the focus point to build the visualization. The third version offers a horizantel bar chart to compare the debt across countries given the year. The play animation enables the viewer to see how country's debt changes over time relative to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the platform has limited options to create a gradient, however, I was able to create hierarchy given the value of the debt by having the largest debt holders be represented by larger bars at the top. I used W3schools to find a gradient of colors that are HTML compatible to make the six coutnries with the largest debt in 1995 to allow a point of comparison as time progresses. I colorcoded OECD as yellow to serve as a average of comparison for the rest of the countries; however, since it only appears from 2007-2020 I would be open to removing that color marker. I also chose yellow, blue and grey as they are optimal for different audiences based on visual abilities and colorblindess. The goal of these color choices is that users can easily compare where a country stands relative to other given the year.
