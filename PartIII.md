Part III of the assignment pushed me to consider, why is this worth my time? In order to find the answer, I reflected on the feedback provided by the user research. Most participants seemed confused by the audience of my site, therefore, I decided to select medical practitioners, researchers and advocates as the intended audience. By selecting this audience, I was able to better understand how to focus the outline I had built out in Part II. The data I needed to present had to educate the audience on why the pregnancy-related mortality rates were so awful. Therefore, my data and storytelling had to in perspective how badly the United States was performing. Considering the audience, I also had to show correlation across several data sets as to what was enabling these high rates of unnecessary pregnacy-related mortalities.
